## Project Description

In the era of AI-driven applications, the Rate My Professor AI Assistant demonstrates the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This project leverages external knowledge bases to enhance the capabilities of large language models, providing accurate and context-aware responses to complex queries.

Tools Used
Next.js: Frontend framework
React: User interface library
Pinecone: Vector database for efficient retrieval
OpenAI API: Language model for generating responses
How RAG is Used
The project combines retrieval-based and generative AI techniques. Pinecone stores up-to-date information, which the OpenAI language model accesses to generate informed responses. This integration creates an AI assistant capable of delivering accurate, context-specific answers about professors and courses.

Project Highlights
Setting up the development environment
Implementing the RAG pipeline
Integrating Pinecone and OpenAI with Next.js
Optimizing performance and handling user queries
