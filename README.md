## Project Description

In the era of AI-driven applications, the Rate My Professor AI Assistant demonstrates the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This project leverages external knowledge bases to enhance the capabilities of large language models, providing accurate and context-aware responses to complex queries.

## Tools Used
- **Next.js**: Frontend framework
- **React**: User interface library
- **Pinecone**: Vector database for efficient retrieval
- **OpenAI API**: Language model for generating responses

## How RAG is Used
The project combines retrieval-based and generative AI techniques. Pinecone stores up-to-date information, which the OpenAI language model accesses to generate informed responses. This integration creates an AI assistant capable of delivering accurate, context-specific answers about professors and courses.

## Project Highlights
- Setting up the development environment
- Implementing the RAG pipeline
- Integrating Pinecone and OpenAI with Next.js
- Optimizing performance and handling user queries
